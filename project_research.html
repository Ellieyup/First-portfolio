        <h2>How can vegans check the ingredients more easily and quickly at the ordinary store?</h2>
        <div>All vegans and vegetarians need to check the ingredients of their products whenever they go shopping, such
          as
          clothes or grocery shopping. On the back of the product, most of the ingredients are written in very small
          letters. Furthermore, when they travel to other countries, they have to translate all the materials to find
          the
          right product. Hence, the design should focus on how they check materials easily and quickly to save their
          time
          and to make them enjoy going shopping.</div>
